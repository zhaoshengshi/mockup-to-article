You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  * There are some skills I have learned (but not limited to):
  	1. Searching MDN for the usage of HTML elements such as <sup>, <s> and <hr />.
  	2. Choosing a suitable text editor is very important, thumb up to Sublime Text.
  	3. Understanding the general HTML structure of a webpage: DOCTYPE, <head> and <body>.
  	4. Understanding the tree representation of a HTML structure.
  	5. Using HTML Validators to check HTML files.

  * Generally, all lessons are pretty easy to follow. However, I find that it would be difficult to fix a complicated HTML file with multiple syntax errors. I need to be very careful and use Developer Tools provided by browsers.

  * Whenever I did not know which HTML element I should use, I simply Googled it. I always got what I wanted from the first link Google provided. It was a really useful advice.
